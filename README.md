### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* As an online trading platform, there are core metrics that can be measured: number of investors of the platform, total value of assets under administration, website traffic and engagement and revenues.

	* Value of Assets: $2B [(14)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hello-stake/about/).

* Stake is currently one of the lower performing platform when observing the data. There are many reasonable reasons as to why the company has its current performance in the online trading market, one perhaps it being a newer company in the market. 

## Recommendations


### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

* Stake is a very well designed trading platform that offers Stocks and ETFs in Australian and US Markets. I would advise the company branch into further markets whilst maintaining its current low cost model to investors. Stake would benefit from expanding their portfolio of offerings into Cryptocurrencies, Commodities , CFDs and broader global exchanges.  

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* With an expanded portfolio of offerings in parallel with a low cost pricing model and user friendly interface, Stake has an enormous opportunity to becomes one of the biggest online trading platforms. If investors were able to trade CFDs, for example, there would be tremendous growth within Stake.
 
### What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?

* In order for Stake to add the suite of products listed above into their portfolio of offerings a substantial number of technologies will need to be incorporated. Including Blockchain, Openlink and Integration into the respective global exchanges.
 
### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

* The most appropriate technology that will be utilised now and into the future, with respect to fintech and future markets is blockchain technology. Utilising blockchain, whereby each transaction is recorded on a block that is linked to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks. This creates a extremely robust structure that makes it difficult for transactions to be altered or tampered with, as any changes would need to be made to all subsequent blocks in the chain. [(17)](https://itmunch.com/blockchain-technology-will-pave-the-way-for-transparent-and-bank-less-financial-services/).
* With this type of structure implemented in new and existing products from Stake, they are sure to be a power within the FinTech space.
